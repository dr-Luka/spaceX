      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p class="about dark">
        Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American aerospace
        manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in
        Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal
        of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of
        Mars.
      </p>
      <p class="about dark">
        SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles, the Starlink satellite
        constellation, the Dragon cargo spacecraft, and flown humans to the
        International Space Station on the SpaceX Dragon 2.
      </p>
      <p class="about dark">
        SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded
        liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008), the first
        private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft
        (Dragon in 2010), the first private company to send a spacecraft to the
        International Space Station (Dragon in 2012), the first Vertical
        take-off and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9
        in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), the
        first private company to launch an object into orbit around the Sun
        (Falcon Heavy's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018), and the first
        private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the International
        Space Station (SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 and SpaceX Crew-1 missions in
        2020).
      </p>
      <p class="about dark">
        In September 2016, Musk unveiled the Interplanetary Transport System —
        subsequently renamed Starship — a privately funded launch system to
        develop spaceflight technology for use in crewed interplanetary
        spaceflight. In 2017, Musk unveiled an updated configuration of the
        system which is intended to handle interplanetary missions plus become
        the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle after the early 2020s, as SpaceX has
        announced it intends to eventually replace its existing Falcon 9 launch
        vehicles and Dragon space capsule fleet with Starship, even in the
        Earth-orbit satellite delivery market. Starship is planned to be fully
        reusable and will be the largest rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for
        the early 2020s.
